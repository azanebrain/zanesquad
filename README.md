# The Squad

This is the Web Client for a practice project that allows friends to share coupon codes for their favorite companies.

# Development

This project uses [Angular](https://angular.io). It project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.2.

Run Angular CLI with `npm run ng` and pass commands like this: `npm run ng -- --help`.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Make sure you also have the API and Databases running. Check the individual branches (`api/master`, `db/master`) for each of those projects' instructions. 

## Redux

This project uses [NGRX](https://ngrx.io) for state management. If you are not familiar with the Redux pattern, I suggest checking out the docs.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run ng -- generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `npm run ng -- generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

End To End tests aren't setup yet.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `npm run ng -- help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
